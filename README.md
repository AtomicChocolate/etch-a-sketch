# Etch-A-Sketch

[**Made as a project for The Odin Project curriculum.**](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project)

A basic pixel grid that fills white squares black whenever your mouse hovers over them, sorta like an Etch-A-Sketch. You can reset the grid and change the grid size.
